    <h3>SCHOLAR LIFE</h3>
    <p>Clean drinking water. Hot showers. Education for all. We’ve come to expect and rely on these basic necessities in our daily lives, and most likely we take them for granted. But what would life be like if these were taken away? For people living in Kibera, Kenya, the largest urban slum in Africa, living without is their daily reality. But in recent years, an organization called Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO) has begun transforming this community by “building urban promise from urban poverty.”</p>
    <p>“I realized that the only way to make someone powerful is through education. With education, a girl can be anything she wants to be,” he explained. This thought sparked the idea that would eventually grow into The Kibera School for Girls. The school began in 2009, and Mr. Odede shared his pride and excitement for the students of the first graduating class. “I am so happy that many of these graduates are coming to America to study in high school,” he said. “These girls are smart. They speak better English than I do and they teach me a lot.”</p>
